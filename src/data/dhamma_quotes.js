  Just as a tree when cut down sprouts up again if the roots remain firm and\n
  uninjured, even so this suffering (of life) returns again and again if the root\n
  of craving is not completely destroyed.\n
  \n
  The man in whom the thirty-six streams of craving flow strongly towards\n
  pleasurable objects, the waves of passions carry off.\n
  He is of confused vision and erroneous thoughts.\n
  \n
  Streams flow everywhere; the creeper\n
  (of passion) sprouts and remains fixed.\n
  If you see that creeper springing up,\n
  cut its root by means of wisdom.\n
  \n
  In creatures there arise pleasures extending towards sense objects.\n
  Immersed in various enjoyments they hanker after them.\n
  Verily, these people are subject to birth and old age.\n
  \n
  People beset by craving circle round and round, like a hare ensnared in a net;\n
  held fast by the (ten) fetters and shackles (that bind man to the wheel of\n
  life), they undergo suffering for a long time, again and again.\n
  \n
  People beset by craving circle round and round, like a hare ensnared in a net;\n
  therefore, let the monk who desires freedom from passion abandon craving.\n
