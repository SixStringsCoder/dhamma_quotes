ignorant, one will always be happy.<br/>
<br/>
He who leads a life in the company of fools suffers long; it is as painful to<br/>
live with fools as it is with a foe; association with the wise brings happiness<br/>
as does the company of one's kinsfolk.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, one should follow the steadfast, the wise, the educated, the<br/>
self-reliant, the dutiful and the noble.<br/>
Even as the moon follows the path of the stars, so ought one to follow such a<br/>
virtuous and highly intelligent man.<br/>

its own pleasure.<br/>

When emptied, it will go lightly.<br/>
Cutting off lust and hatred,<br/>
you will reach nibbāna.<br/>

(Of the fetters) cut off the five, renounce the five, and (of the virtues)<br/>
cultivate the five.<br/>
He who has gone beyond the five attachments is called a bhikkhu who has crossed<br/>
the stream.<br/>
<br/>
Meditate, O monk! Be not heedless! Let not your mind wander among the pleasures<br/>
of the senses, lest through your heedlessness you swallow the red-hot iron ball<br/>
(in hell) and cry out, as you thus burn - This is suffering.<br/>
<br/>
There is no perfect contemplation for him who is not wise, and no wisdom for him<br/>
who does not concentrate.<br/>
He in whom there is both perfect contemplation and wisdom is, indeed,<br/>
<br/>
close to nibbāna.<br/>

The mendicant who has withdrawn to a lonely spot, whose heart and mind are<br/>
tranquil, who clearly perceives the Dhamma, his bliss (of contemplation) is more<br/>
than human.<br/>

Whenever one clearly comprehends the origin and destruction of the five<br/>
aggregates (khandha), he experiences bliss and happiness.<br/>
This is as the nectar (of immortality) to those who truly comprehend it.<br/>
<br/>
In this world this becomes the first requisite for a wise monk: control of the<br/>
senses, contentment, restraint according to the fundamental code of monastic<br/>
law; cultivation of noble friends whose lives are pure and who are not<br/>
indolent.<br/>
<br/>
The mendicant who is hospitable and friendly, who really lives his ethics and is<br/>
full of spiritual joy, thereby makes an end of his suffering.<br/>
